# SSH-Botnet
This project demonstrates how an SSH-based botnet can be built and controlled using Python. The script allows users to connect to multiple SSH-enabled devices (bots), execute remote commands, and even launch a basic DDoS attack.
This Python script provides the following functionalities:
- 1. List Bots: View all connected SSH bots.
- 2. Execute Commands: Send commands to all bots for remote execution.
- 3. Interactive Bash Shell: Run commands interactively on bots.
- 4. Add Bots: Add new SSH clients (bots) to the botnet network.
- 5. Perform a DDoS Attack: Simulate a SYN flood attack on a target.
- 6. Save & Load Botnet: Store bot information in a JSON file to reconnect later
