# SSH-Botnet
This project demonstrates how an SSH-based botnet can be built and controlled using Python. By this script we can connect to multiple SSH-enabled devices (bots), execute remote commands, and even launch a basic DDoS attack.
This Python script provides the following functionalities:
- List Bots: View all connected SSH bots.
- Execute Commands: Send commands to all bots for remote execution.
- Interactive Bash Shell: Run commands interactively on bots.
- Add Bots: Add new SSH clients (bots) to the botnet network.
- Perform a DDoS Attack: Simulate a SYN flood attack on a target.
- Save & Load Botnet: Store bot information in a JSON file to reconnect later
